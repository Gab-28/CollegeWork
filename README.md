The aim of the present assignment is to create an application that consists of a Graphical User Interface. One must design and create a Java Swing application that implements JSlider and JTextArea. The application will show a circle with a default diameter and 4 JSliders on one side of the screen. One slider will control the diameter and the following 3 will control the colors Red, Green and Blue. If the user wants to change the diameter, it is only necessary to move the slider. The same will happen to the colors.
At the bottom of the GUI the user will find a JTextArea that displays the diameter and a list of languages the user can choose.
